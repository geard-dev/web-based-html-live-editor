# Web Based HTML Live Editor

## About

This is a live online code editor. It uses [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/), which is actually what [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) uses in the backend for the actual editor. You can [self host](https://github.com/geard-dev/web-based-live-code-editor#self-hosting) it or access it through my [Github Pages](https://live-editor.js.org/). Live means that as soon as you write the code, the screen on the side shows what it looks like, no saving or reloading needed.

## Access

You can access the Live Editor at https://live-editor.js.org

## Self Hosting

This only uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so if you want to self host the editor, all you have to do is clone the repo and open the index.html file
